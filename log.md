### Day 1: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intro to R on DataCamp. Finished 3 sections: factors, data frames, and lists.

**Thoughts:** Fairly routine day. Nothing too tricky. Hopefully I've remembered everything I learned today.

**Progress**: Most of the progress was reading the data mining material.

Day 6-8: April 15-17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Python on DataCamp. 

Day 9: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Intro to Python course on DataCamp! Finished the Functions and Packages sections as well as the Numpy section. The way Numpy was explained in the DataCamp course made a lot more sense than when I read about Numpy for class. Doing always beats reading.
