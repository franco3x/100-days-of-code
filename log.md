# 100 Days Of Code/Data Science - Log

### Day 1: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kind of a 'busy' day. Started PluralSight's interactive SQL course titled, "SQL: Using Joins, Constraints, Normalization, and Subqueries". Got throught the first portion on aggregate functions. I also started and finished the course Python: The Big Picture on PluralSight. It was a very quick course, like an hour long. And I watched it on 2x speed. PluralSight allows you to choose a path and a RoleIQ. The path I've chosen is the Python path, and the RoleIQ I've chosen is Data Analyst (Python). I also read some of the required reading for my SQL class (uCertify). Lastly, I read a little bit of SQL for Dummies. I like that a whole lot more than uCertify.

**Thoughts:** The Big Picture is for EXTREME beginners in Python. Even more beginnery than me. I honestly didn't learn too much, but that's ok. It was a quick course. Lord help me with this uCertify course.

### Day 2: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished reading the first chapter on SQL on uCertify. I think I hate uCertify. Went over relationships and data redundancy. I feel like I don't retain what I read (as evidenced by my flash card score lol). I'll go over over some of it again, and of course, I'll go through the flash cards again.

### Day 3: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd module (Constraints) of PluralSight's interactive SQL course titled, "SQL: Using Joins, Constraints, Normalization, and Subqueries". Very helpful. Went over constraints (duh) such as primary keys and foreign keys. Also discussed check constraints. Started the 3rd module called Normalization & Relationships on my lunch break. This on has me thinking about a 'side' project I'm doing for work. I may have figured out how to address a particular issue I was worried about.

I spoke with my WGU program mentor and he reminded me about the website db-fiddle.com. I will check it out later today.

### Day 4: October 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished PluralSight's interactive SQL course on joins, constraints, normalization, and subqueries. Aliases are so clutch. Also, I need more work on subqueries.

### Day 5: October 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I decided to go through the SQL training on www.w3schools.com. Of course, the beginning is stuff I already know. Went over SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, and NOT. The one thing that was new was DISTINCT. The PluralSight training I did used UNIQUE. I think they're essentially the same thing.

### Day 6: October 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began the 2nd chapter of the uCertify SQL course. It's on the entity relationship model.

### Day 7: October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Focused on #SQL today by reading the uCertify material. I also read some material and did some practice exercises on http://w3schools.com. I really enjoy that.

### Day 8: October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read a little bit of #SQL today but decided to take a mini-break to start the Iris dataset project. I decided to use #Python and to do it in Google Colab. It took me a little minute to sync Colab with my G Drive but it works. I also played with http://db-fiddle.com using a list of commands from my course instructor. Everything worked except entering foreign keys while creating a table. I was able to insert an FK after creating the table though.

### Day 9: October 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the Iris dataset project using #python. I think it's mandatory for #datasciencenewbies to run through this project lol I enjoyed it and learned a lot.

Also, this project I'm doing at work is data sciency. I mean, the first thing you have to do in data science is clean the data, right? Well I've been cleaning and cleaning and cleaning lol
