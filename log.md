# 100 Days Of Code/Data Science - Log

### Day 1: October 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kind of a 'busy' day. Started PluralSight's interactive SQL course titled, "SQL: Using Joins, Constraints, Normalization, and Subqueries". Got throught the first portion on aggregate functions. I also started and finished the course Python: The Big Picture on PluralSight. It was a very quick course, like an hour long. And I watched it on 2x speed. PluralSight allows you to choose a path and a RoleIQ. The path I've chosen is the Python path, and the RoleIQ I've chosen is Data Analyst (Python). I also read some of the required reading for my SQL class (uCertify). Lastly, I read a little bit of SQL for Dummies. I like that a whole lot more than uCertify.

**Thoughts:** The Big Picture is for EXTREME beginners in Python. Even more beginnery than me. I honestly didn't learn too much, but that's ok. It was a quick course. Lord help me with this uCertify course.

### Day 2: October 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished reading the first chapter on SQL on uCertify. I think I hate uCertify. Went over relationships and data redundancy. I feel like I don't retain what I read (as evidenced by my flash card score lol). I'll go over over some of it again, and of course, I'll go through the flash cards again.

### Day 3: October 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 2nd module (Constraints) of PluralSight's interactive SQL course titled, "SQL: Using Joins, Constraints, Normalization, and Subqueries". Very helpful. Went over constraints (duh) such as primary keys and foreign keys. Also discussed check constraints. Started the 3rd module called Normalization & Relationships on my lunch break. This on has me thinking about a 'side' project I'm doing for work. I may have figured out how to address a particular issue I was worried about.

I spoke with my WGU program mentor and he reminded me about the website db-fiddle.com. I will check it out later today.
